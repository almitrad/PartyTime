**Party Time** is a web application created at Cal Hacks 5.0. 

## How It Works:
For incoming college students, integrating into a unversities party culture can be both stressful and exhilerating. Party Time is an application that provides an easy way of navigating through a school's party culture. After creating an account, a student can explore parties that are open on a certain night, choose the desired party, and add it to their interested parties. Our application serves as a platform for party attendees to make educated decisions on the party they want to attend through a 5-star rating system and blog-like review section. This allows for both new party attendees and frequent party attendees alike, to be able to choose the best party on the block.  

This application also provides a portal for party hosts. Not only can party hosts create a page for their fraternity or sorority, they can also send personalized invites to invite students to their selective parties. Furthermore, this platform serves as an effective method of publicizing for smaller parties and serves as a method of exploring parties that might otherwise be unknown. 

Ulimately, this application provides a streamlined platform for exploring, rating, and attending parties for both attendees and hosts.
